        <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>At ShopMerger, we make shopping smarter by bringing everything together in one place. Inspired by platforms like PC Part Picker, our centralized shopping cart lets you discover, compare, and organize products across multiple online retailers, all without the hassle of bouncing between tabs.</p>
            <p>We don’t sell products directly—instead, we give you the power to browse curated options, track prices, and build your cart from different sites, then link you straight to the best deals available. Think of us as your shopping companion, helping you save time, stay organized, and shop with confidence.</p>
            <p>Our mission is simple: make online shopping easier, clearer, and more efficient.</p>
            <p>One cart. Endless choices. Smarter shopping.</p>
